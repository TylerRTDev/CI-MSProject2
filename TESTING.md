## ðŸ§ª Testing

Testing for the "Do You Remember" game focused primarily on manual testing to ensure robust game logic and an optimal user experience, with automated testing considered only for core logic functions. The following sections outline the various testing procedures used throughout development.

### Overview
Manual testing (user testing) was conducted by interacting with the gameâ€”clicking buttons, entering sequence lengths, and verifying real-time feedbackâ€”to ensure that the game logic, responsiveness, and UI elements work as intended. Although automated testing using frameworks such as Jest was explored for core functions (e.g., `generatePattern`, `resetGame`, `checkUserInput`), it was not fully implemented so that more development time could be dedicated to refining the game experience.

### JavaScript Validation
The JavaScript code was tested using [JSLint](https://www.jslint.com/) to identify potential issues and enforce best practices. The validation process flagged several stylistic warnings, including preferences for var over let, enforcing alphabetical property order, and restricting line lengths. However, these warnings were primarily cosmetic and did not impact functionality, readability, or performance. Additionally, .toFixed(2) was incorrectly flagged as an unexpected expression despite its valid use in rounding calculations. After reviewing these warnings, only those that provided meaningful improvements to the code were implemented, while unnecessary stylistic suggestions were intentionally ignored. This ensured that the core game functionsâ€”such as pattern generation, user input verification, and score trackingâ€”worked as expected without introducing unnecessary modifications.

JSLint returned no issues, confirming that the JavaScript code meets its validation standards.

The linter provided several stylistic warnings that do not affect the functionality, readability, or performance of the code. First, it enforced the use of var instead of let, despite let being the modern best practice due to its block-scoped behavior, which prevents unintended modifications. 

The linter flagged an unexpected issue with .toFixed(2), despite it being a valid method for rounding numbers to two decimal places. Since this does not affect execution, and modern JavaScript engines handle it correctly, this warning has been intentionally ignored, as it does not indicate a real issue.

The linter flagged warnings for lines exceeding 80 characters, but these do not impact functionality or readability in a meaningful way. Breaking long lines is primarily a stylistic preference and is not required by JavaScript for correct execution. In this case, the flagged lines involve JSON parsing and template literals, both of which remain clear and easy to understand in their current form. Splitting them would introduce unnecessary line breaks, making the code less readable rather than improving clarity. Given that modern editors handle long lines well with automatic wrapping, these warnings have been intentionally ignored, as they do not provide any functional benefit.

### Performance
Performance was measured using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome DevTools. The game scored well across performance metrics, including load time and accessibility. Tests on a variety of devices (laptops, tablets, and mobile devices) confirmed that the game remains responsive and visually consistent.

### Browser Compatibility
The game was tested on multiple browsers, including:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

All major featuresâ€”from game logic and sound integration to responsive layoutâ€”functioned consistently across these browsers.

### Testing User Stories
User stories guided testing to ensure the game meets user expectations:
- **First-Time Visitor:** Clear instructions are provided via the "How to Play" modal.
- **Returning Visitor:** Quick game restarts and persistent high scores are confirmed.
- **Competitive Player:** The leaderboard accurately records and displays high scores.
- **General User:** Real-time feedback (both visual and audio) confirms correct or incorrect guesses.

#### Leaderboard Functionality
The leaderboard records the **top 5 scores** only. When a player achieves a high score, they are prompted to enter their name, which will be displayed on the leaderboard alongside their score and ranking. Players also have the ability to reset the leaderboard, removing all stored scores and names.

| Feature                     | Action                                     | Expected Result                                              | Status  | Comments |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| High Score Entry            | Complete a game with a high score          | Prompt appears for name entry if score qualifies for top 5  | Passed  | N/A      |
| Player Score Entry                 | Complete a game with a score under top 5   | Prompt appears for score                                     | Passed  | N/A      |
| Leaderboard Display         | View the leaderboard                       | Displays top 5 scores sorted in descending order             | Passed  | N/A      |
| Name and Score Visibility   | Enter a name with a high score             | Name and score appear correctly on the leaderboard           | Passed  | N/A      |
| Leaderboard Reset           | Click the reset leaderboard button         | All names and scores are cleared from the leaderboard       | Passed  | N/A      |

#### Game Difficulty and Score Multiplier
The game's difficulty setting directly impacts the score multiplier. The difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard) adjust the pattern complexity and speed of the game. Additionally, the game speed setting, which can be adjusted in the settings menu, further modifies the score multiplier.

| Feature                | Action                              | Expected Result                                      | Status  | Comments |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| Adjust Game Difficulty | Select different difficulty levels | Score multiplier increases with higher difficulties | Passed  | N/A      |
| Change Game Speed      | Adjust game speed in settings      | Score is calculated based on speed multiplier       | Passed  | N/A      |

### Automated Testing
While the bulk of testing was manual, automated testing was considered for future enhancements. Core game logic functions (e.g., `generatePattern`, `resetGame`, `checkUserInput`) are candidates for unit tests using frameworks such as Jest.

Automated testing involves writing scripts or using tools to execute test cases without human intervention. It allows for repetitive, consistent, and fast validation of the softwareâ€™s functionality, making it ideal for catching regressions (bugs introduced after changes).

#### When to Use Automated Testing in Do You Rememeber?:

Testing Core Game Logic: 

- Write unit tests (e.g., using Jest for JavaScript) to validate core game functions such as:
  - Generating random sequences correctly.
  - Storing and retrieving scores from localStorage.
  - Verifying if the userâ€™s input matches the generated sequence.
- Performance Testing: Automated tools can check how the game handles different difficulty levels and speed settings.
- Regression Testing: If you update the game (e.g., changing difficulty settings), automated tests ensure existing features still work as expected.
