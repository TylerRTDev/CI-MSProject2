## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation


### Deployment Procedure

All steps below can be performed using <u>***Visual Studio Code***</u>.

To deploy the Pump Fitness Gym website, follow these detailed steps:

### 1. Obtain the Project Files:

You can obtain the project files either by cloning the repository or downloading them directly from GitHub.

#### **Option A: Clone the Repository:**

Cloning the repository allows you to have a local copy of the website's codebase, which you can easily update if the original repository changes.

1. **Open a terminal** on your local machine.
2. **Run the following command** to clone the repository:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/TylerRTDev/CI-MSProject2.git 
```
This command will download the repository into a folder named `CI-MSProject2`.

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```cmd
cd CI-MSProject2
```
This places you inside the project directory where all the website files are located.

### Set Up the Environment:

Ensure you have a web server environment such as Apache or Nginx. For local testing, you can use a simple server with Python:

```cmd
python3 -m http.server 3000
```
This will start the python server.

### Configure Domain:
1. **Open a new terminal and type the following:**
```cmd
ipconfig
```
This will give you the ability to see what your ip address is.

2. **Copy the IP Address and combine it to the server address:**

Domain URL: `https://[your-ip-address-here]:3000/`

When you use `127.0.0.1` in a web browser, you're connecting to a server running on your own computer.

Open your web browser and navigate to your domain to verify that the website is working as expected.

### Test the Deployment:

If you have set up the server correctly you should also be able to navigate to the site via the following link: ***Domain URL example***: **```http://127.0.0.1:3000/```**

You can also use your own IP Address as an alternative.

## üß† Game Logic Explanation

### **Game Mechanics**
- **Pattern Generation:** Random sequences generated dynamically.
- **User Interaction:** Real-time response to player inputs.
- **Difficulty Scaling:** Adjustable game speed and complexity.
- **Score Tracking:** Immediate feedback and score updates after each round.

### **Gameplay Flow Overview:**
- The game generates a random sequence of colored buttons.
- Players must memorize and replicate the sequence.
- Each correct pattern increases the score and advances the level.
- Player score evaluated and added to the leaderboard if it qualifies. 

### üß© **Pattern Logic Functions**

#### **1. generatePattern**
<details>
<summary>View Code</summary>

```javascript
function generatePattern() {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * buttons.length);
    gamePattern.push(buttons[randomIndex].dataset.id);
    playPattern();
}
```
</details>

- **Purpose:** Generates a random pattern by selecting a button ID from the grid and adds it to `gamePattern`.
- **Dependencies:** `buttons` (updated by `setDifficulty`), `playPattern`.
- **Previous Iteration:** Earlier versions used hardcoded button IDs and failed on difficulty changes.

```javascript
function resetGame() {
    gamePattern = [];
    userPattern = [];
    gameScore = 0;
    gameLevel = 1;
    gameActive = false;
    scoreDisplay.textContent = `üìã Your Score: ${gameScore}`;
    levelDisplay.textContent = `Level: ${gameLevel}`;
    startMessageDisplay.textContent = '';
    endMessageDisplay.textContent = '';
}
```
</details>

- **Purpose:** Resets the game state, clearing patterns, score, and messages.
- **Dependencies:** `scoreDisplay`, `levelDisplay`, `startMessageDisplay`, `endMessageDisplay`.

    if (userPattern[currentStep] === gamePattern[currentStep]) {
        if (userPattern.length === gamePattern.length) {
            const difficulty = difficultySelect.value;
            const speedMult = getMultiplier(gameSpeed);
            const diffMult = difficultyMultiplier[difficulty] || 1.0;
            const totalMultiplier = speedMult * diffMult;

            gameScore += Math.floor(10 * totalMultiplier);
            gameLevel++;
            scoreDisplay.textContent = `Your Score: ${gameScore}`;
            levelDisplay.textContent = `Level: ${gameLevel}`;

            userPattern = [];
            setTimeout(() => {
                startMessageDisplay.textContent = gameMessage;
                generatePattern();
            }, 5000 / gameSpeed);

            setTimeout(() => {
                levelUp();
            }, 500);
        }
    } else {
        endGame();
        setTimeout(() => {
            gameOver();
            resetGame();
        }, 1000);
    }
}
```
</details>
